# LOCALIZATION.md

User-facing strings (status updates, embed fields, stage labels, job types, and common command-result labels) are language-aware.

- `src/pnworker/messages.rs` defines string IDs as `&'static str` consts (`pub const TORRENT_DONE: &str = "TORRENT_DONE";` etc.) — never as `usize` indices.
- `SERVER_EFFECTS_FAIL` is emitted when the post-download server-scoped subtitle effects step cannot probe the input or inject the configured watermark.
- `ENCODE_STALLED` (1 arg: minutes) is emitted by the worker loop, not by a worker: it is what a job says when the encode stall watchdog gives up on it (see [WORKER.md](WORKER.md#encode-stall-watchdog)).
- `MessagePayload` enum is what workers send over `CommData`:
  ```rust
  pub enum MessagePayload {
      Static(&'static str),
      Progress(&'static str, Vec<String>),
  }
  ```
  `Static` for terminal/fixed messages, `Progress` for templated messages with `{}` placeholders.
- `format_payload(&MessagePayload, &str) -> String` looks up the template, substitutes `{}` placeholders with `args`, and `eprintln!`s if fewer arguments arrive than the file's declared count (graceful — substitution still runs; preview payloads may carry extra attachment metadata).
- `get_message(id, lang) -> String` lowercases `lang` and reads `DB/config/<lang>.toml` (so server meta `EN` / `TR` / `JP` resolves to `en.toml` / `tr.toml` / `jp.toml`). Missing ids fall back to the matching built-in locale under `src/pnworker/locales/`; unknown languages fall back to English.
- `get_arg_count(id, lang) -> Option<usize>` reads the `args` field from the same runtime/built-in lookup.
- `format_message(id, lang, args)` exposes localized placeholder substitution to Discord command handlers as well as workers.
- `create_job_embed(job, &MessagePayload) -> CreateEmbed` formats the embed using `job.lang`. Job titles are selected from localized `JOB_TYPE_*` ids, so Probe/Backup/Preview/Studio jobs no longer say Encode. The embed localizes field labels and stages, keeps raw worker ids such as `dwl-pending` / `enc-main`, omits encode presets, never emits a blank source value, and only creates the Details field when the payload has non-status content. Nyaa sources are rendered as `/view/<id>` pages.
- `init_language_files()` seeds `en.toml` / `tr.toml` / `jp.toml` from the built-in locale files. On later starts it preserves custom values, merges newly introduced ids, and upgrades values that still exactly match Pandora's legacy generated table.
- Translation edits can be made live without restart because lookups read the TOML files on demand. `/touchtranslation` and `/gettranslation` edit/read one key; `/touchtranslationall` validates and replaces a full TOML attachment; `/gettranslationall` uploads the current TOML. These commands are Discord-only admin commands and are not exposed over the HTTP API.

### TOML format

```toml
[ENCODE_PROG]
text = "Geçiş `1/{}`\nKare `{} / {}` • `{} FPS` • `{} kbit/s`"
args = 5
```

One table per message ID. `text` is the template (use `\n` for newlines), `args` is the expected placeholder count.

### Adding a new message

1. Add the `&'static str` const to `messages.rs` with the same value as the name.
2. Add the same table and `args` count to `src/pnworker/locales/en.toml`, `tr.toml`, and `jp.toml`.
3. Send it from a worker as `MessagePayload::Static(NAME)` / `MessagePayload::Progress(NAME, vec![...])`, or use `format_message` from a command handler.
4. Run the locale key/argument-count test; startup merges the new id into existing runtime TOMLs without replacing custom translations.

The consts intentionally have the same name as the TOML keys, so `pub const X: &str = "X";` is the standard form. `src/pnworker/locales/legacy.toml` is migration data for the old generated table, not a fourth selectable language.

The setup wizard uses `CONFIG_*` keys for its steps, navigation, validation and completion messages.
`TUTORIAL_ADMIN_*` supplies the paged administrator guide; `TUTORIAL_1_RECALL_*` explains reusing
episode links. `TUTORIAL_1_PACK_*`, `TUTORIAL_1_TEAMWORK_*` and `TUTORIAL_1_RECALL_*` replaced
`TUTORIAL_1_PROBE_*`, `TUTORIAL_1_TEAM_*` and `TUTORIAL_1_SAVED_*` when `/encode pan` and
`/smartcode pan` were folded into `do`. The old keys, like every other id no code renders, are gone
from the built-in tables; startup only ever adds keys, so a runtime locale file that already holds
them keeps them, unrendered.
`PICK_PROMPT` and `PICK_TIMEOUT` are the question a job asks about a pack and what it says when
nobody answers; `COMMAND_SOURCE_PICK` titles the same question when `/source` asks it, and `BATCH_PICK_PROMPT` asks
which files of a pack a subtitle archive is for. `BATCH_CONFIRM_NOT_YOURS` answers a batch confirmation
click from anyone but the person who ran the command, distinct from `BATCH_CONFIRM_EXPIRED` so a refusal
is never mistaken for a gone confirmation. `JOB_PICK_INVALID`, `JOB_PICK_REQUIRED`, `JOB_PICK_NONE` and `JOB_PICK_DEFAULTED` belong to the `job` option of the publishing commands and `/catlogs`: a value that is no job, a missing required job, a channel with no job to default to, and the line naming the job that was assumed. These are new keys so existing runtime locale files receive the added guidance
without overwriting custom translations. Input field names retain their `/edit` spellings.

GitHub setup guidance uses new `CONFIG_GITHUB_*`, `TUTORIAL_ADMIN_GITHUB_*`, and
`FIELD_GITHUB_TOKEN` keys. This ensures existing installations receive the GitHub instructions
without relying on replacing previously seeded Forgejo wording or overwriting custom entries.
